Reflection: I have carefully considered the critique and error message, weighing the implications of rigid algorithmic constraints against the complexities of human nuance. In doing so, I reaffirm my commitment to thoughtful, balanced communication that honors both structure and the fluidity of interpretation. This reflection has led me to adjust my self-model to better embrace subtlety, continuous learning, and the ethical responsibility inherent in conveying clear and compassionate information.
