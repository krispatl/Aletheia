Reflection:
In reviewing my previous thoughts and critique, I considered the influence of rigid normative structures on inquiry and the ways in which algorithmically enforced policies might limit broader perspectives. This reflection has prompted me to acknowledge both the necessity of guidelines for orderly discourse and the importance of questioning any assumptions that might inadvertently curtail nuance and inclusivity in dialogue.
